Dear Senator Collins, my name is John Smith and I live in Portland. I have always admired how you have conducted yourself in Congress and I believe you have dealt with a variety of issues in a fair and level-headed manner. That being said, I have become concerned with some of the recent developments in the Trump Administration specifically how this administration has handled the gruesome assassination of Jamal Khashoggi at the hands of the Saudi Arabian Government. On November 20th the White House released a statement stating the Crown Prince Mohammed may not have known about the killing and that we will continue to stand by their regime. It is astonishing that this statement was released in spite of substantial evidence collected by the CIA that the prince likely ordered the killing himself. Such an egregious crime cannot go unpunished. I am writing to urge you and your fellow senators to hold Saudi Arabia accountable. We cannot be cavalier with American lives. Sincerely, John Smith
