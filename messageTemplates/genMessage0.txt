Dear Senator _, My name is John Smith and I am one of your constituents.Â  I have always respected how you have conducted yourself and how you have represented the people of our great state. That being said, I have become concerned with some of the actions of the Trump administration, namely how he has handled the assassination of Jamal Khashoggi by the Saudi Arabian Government. On November 20th the White House released a statement saying that the crown prince likely had no knowledge of the killing. This statement was released in spite of a CIA report that linked the Assassination directly to Crown Prince Mohammed himself. This egregious crime cannot go unpunished. I am writing to urge you and your fellow senators to enact some form of sanctions against Saudi Arabia. We cannot be cavalier with American lives. Sincerely, John Smith
