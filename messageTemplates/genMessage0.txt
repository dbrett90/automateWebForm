Dear Senator _, As your constituent, I respectfully request your support for increasing aid to Ukraine. Recently, Ukraine and the United States have enhanced their relationship with the signing of a renewed U.S.- Ukraine Charter on Strategic Partnership. Its preamble states emphatically the United States’ “unwavering commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders, including Crimea.”

Ukraine is facing imminent peril at the hands of Russia’s continued aggression. Please support efforts to enact immediate sanctions against the NordStream2 political pipeline, to immediately provide increased levels of military assistance to Ukraine, and to integrate Ukraine further into Euro-Atlantic structures by providing membership in NATO. Your support of Ukraine and its strategic importance to the national security interests of the United States would be greatly appreciated.
